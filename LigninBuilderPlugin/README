The easiest way to get this installed is to unzip this directory and add the directory to your .vmdrc file as follows:

lappend auto_path /path/to/this/directory

From there, you can generate and minimize the lignins contained within a library file through the following commands within VMD.

package require ligninbuilder
ligninbuilder::buildfromlibrary /path/to/library/text/file.txt Spruce
ligninbuilder::minimizestructures Spruce namd2 "+p8"

These commands will generate structrually sane lignins from the "file.txt" library in the Spruce directory.
